# Updating Your Capacitor Electron Project

<p class="intro">Occasionally, you'll need to make Capacitor updates to your Electron app, including new ways of interfacing with Capacitor inside of your Electron codebase.</a>

## Updating Electron Project

To update the base structure of your Electron project, view the [electron-template](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor/tree/master/electron-template) project in the Capacitor repo, under the tag corresponding to the latest stable release of Capacitor. The core project is kept simple on purpose: it shouldn't take much time to see what is different from the core project and your project.
